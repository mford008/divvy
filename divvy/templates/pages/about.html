    <p>Jane moves into a new apartment building but doesn't have all
      the appliances/household items she needs.  She logs into this
      app to find out who in her apartment building has a vacuum for
      her to borrow. She joins the ‘group’ for her apartment building
      and finds that one of her new neighbors has one listed that is
      available to borrow. She submits a borrow request, and a time frame
      that works for them both. Jane borrows the vacuum, returns it shortly
      after, and everyone is happy! A few weeks later, she lists her power
      drill as available for anyone in her complex to borrow. </p>
